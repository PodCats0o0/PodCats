            <h2>Things that went well during the stream</h2>
            <p> The team were able to construct a lot of events during the stream and the following are the things that went well during the stream:</p>
            
            <p> 
               <ul>
                <li>We changed our design and it fitted well with our topic.</li> <br> 
               <li>The chat box that failed with the last stream managed to work.</li> <br> 
               <li>Some of our members' audio is audible to viewers and our background music is very well matched with the vibe we are hoping for. </li> <br>
               <li>We had active viewers that participated with our challenges and managed to give out the giveaways ONSITE to our winners.</li> <br>
               <li>We managed to start the stream at the exact time we planned for.</li> <br>
               <li>We practiced and had a dry run before the stream to give us time to be ready.</li> <br>
               
               
            <h4> Conclusion </h4>
            <p>We have a lot of things that went well during our stream, like how our design and background music fits the chill vibe we were going for. We did our best with our second stream and had less difficulties than before. Overall we enjoyed doing our stream despite having new difficulties to overcome.</p>
            
            
        <!----Areas of Opportunity---->
        <h2> Areas of Opportunity </h2>
            
            <p>We had less technical difficulties in our second stream than the first one, however we still had problems along the way. </p> <br>
            
            <li>Wifi connection, our wifi connection became one of our technical difficulties due the low signal and a large amount of people connecting to our wifi connection.</li> <br>
            <li>We didn't have any back up plan, that caused us other problems. Just like ending our live stream in the middle of explaining our topic. </li> <br>
            
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>We are still pleased that we had less technical difficulties unlike our last live stream and we still had fun along the way.</p>
