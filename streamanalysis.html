        <h1>Summary of Stream</h1>
        
        <p>The first podcast and live stream of the group, also known as "PodCats", was streamed on the day of February 4, 2024. It was respectively streamed on the own houses of the members and used their own devices online. The topic of the stream revolved only around the concept of blended learning, experiences of students in a blended learning modality, and as well sharing of experiences from the speakers. The first 15 minutes was used for the preparation of the members for the stream while waiting for viewers. After the “Getting Ready” part, we started straight to the introduction of the group and members. We used 3 minute and 30 seconds video that includes all video clips that can be seen inside of the classroom and asynchronously to show the expected scenarios in that modality. After the presentation of the video, each member discussed and shared their thoughts about the context inside it. The discussion took a while before it had a short rest in between the stream. The discussion between the members proceeded again spontaneously after the 10 minutes rest. After the successful 56 minute stream, the live show finally ended with a farewell and gratitude statements to the viewers. Despite the large number of technical difficulties, the discussion was successfully discussed with the advantages and disadvantages mentioned resulting for us to fortunately examine the efficacy of it to students' performance.</p></ul>
        
        <h1>Things That Went Well</h1>
        
        <ul><li>The first thing that went well is that most of the stream design matched the streaming size, which produces a pleasant and interactive design for the stream. Those stream outlines that went well include the thumbnail, getting ready border, rest border, camera overlay, and the ending border..</li>
        
        <li>The background music used in the getting ready, rest, and ending border worked properly without being copyrighted. Additionally, the background music from the video for the presentation was played successfully as well without any interruption..</li>
        
        <li>Web cameras during the stream were shown to the stream successfully as well. It was clear and everyone was seen during the video. </li>
        
        <li>The management of the microphone of each speaker was audible and loud during the stream. .</li>
                           
        <li>The speakers and host successfully discussed the benefits, disadvantages, experiences, and events during the classes of blended learning environments.</li>
        
        <li>Halfway through the stream whilst managing to finish the script we made, we  improvised later on by sharing our own experiences and thoughts about Blended Learning successfully without having a script to read.</li>
        
        <li>At the beginning of our stream, our commercial was shown smoothly. At times where we would have technical difficulties, we would showcase our commercial once again to fix the issue.</li>
        
        <li>For the outro of our stream, it was shown adequately and clean. We managed to say our goodbyes in an appropriate manner and closed an endpoint.</li>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>We have a lot of things that went well with our streaming, like our stream design, background music that fits and cameras that are clear and noticeable. Our microphones are audible and loud but understandable, same with our outro that is clean and appropriate goodbyes for viewers. While we did good with our commercials and with our improvised lines that made us enjoy the whole streaming platform.</p>
        
        <h1>Areas of Opportunity</h1>
        
        <p>We tend to have multiple complications on our streaming day. But we still manage to finish it and have fun while doing it. Our team/group have a lot of complications during streaming and this is what we learned by that complications: </P>
        
        <li>Learn to be active and cooperative on the important day. Especially on the day the whole group needs to be together.  This is due to the fact that two of our members are inactive and unaware during the day of streaming.</li>
        
        <li>Explore and know how to manage or operate our streaming platform. To lessen the complications. This is because we did not explore the streaming platform and we did not know how to operate it well. </li>
        
        <li>To practice our script or lines more together or not, to have an easy going  and comfortable streaming. Due to our awkward silence and a long and repetitive  commercial.</li>
        
        <li>To prepare a day or two before the streaming or anything important. To have no more complications in the future.  Due to our lack of awareness of the day of streaming. </li>
        
        <li>And be aware of the controls in the broadcasting software. Since this is the one that controls what can be shown to the public. For example, accidentally showing the script due to a misclick in the software.</li>
        
        <li>To be more confident in what we do and have fun while doing it correctly. At this point we were nervous to a point we kept making mistakes.</li>
        
        <li>To have more interactions with others. Not just ourselves. By this we didn't get to communicate with the viewers due to lack of knowledge of our broadcasting platform.</li>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>We are open to opportunities to take just like being present on the day of streaming, to explore our broadcasting platform before the day of streaming. To practice our streaming and script, and to not show the script while live. And to have more interaction with the viewers.</p>
        
        <h3>Viewership</h3>
        <p>According to the data that we have collected the stream was able to get the average viewership of 7 - 10 views while the stream was ongoing and made 73 views in total since it was published. The number of participants/views were lower than expected due to improper or lack of advertisements for the date and time of the stream. We have been advertising our stream weeks before it was published to build up the audience though we failed to advertise it the day it was published. The time of our stream also coincides with the time of the streams of other groups, which results in the viewers splitting between the streams.</p>
        
        <h3>Level of Engagement </h3>
        <p>(0:00 - 56:27) The level of engagement for our stream was low due to our stream chat being turned off. We had technical difficulties figuring out how to turn on chat because we were unaware that our chat was disabled, not until we started our stream. As soon as we saw that our chat was disabled, we tried to fix it in the settings so that we are able to interact with viewers as we planned. Unfortunately, we couldn’t figure out how to fix our problem despite asking multiple friends and researching on google for help. Therefore, we had no choice but to continue our stream without any interaction with our viewers.</p>
