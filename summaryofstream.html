            <p> <br>
                To start the stream off explaining study techniques, giving questions to the viewers along the way in order to create engagement between viewers and participants we also gave a quiz to the viewers in order to tell if they are participating, those who answer the questions correctly will also receive a prize. Overall the tips and techniques were given, despite technical difficulties The stream was considered successful given that it had an average viewership of about 20 people and a total of 122-140 viewers.
                <br> <br>
                The stream started at 4:05 PM, the first half was about explaining the topic of the stream which was "Study Techniques", as the hosts were explaining and discussing the different study techniques the stream was cut short due to technical difficulties, throughout this period of the stream the moderator asked the audience about what they have learned or heard from the host before the stream was cut, the moderator started a poll and asked quizzes to better engage with the audience while the stream was being fixed, the stream ended and stacked a very descent viewership of 20 views.
